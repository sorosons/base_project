Clean Architecture with StreamController
This repository contains a foundational Flutter project demonstrating the Clean Architecture pattern with state management through StreamController. Clean Architecture is a robust architectural pattern that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability by organizing code into distinct layers: Presentation, Domain, and Data.

Features
Modular Structure: The project adheres to Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns into isolated layers for clear organization and testability.
StreamController State Management: Utilizes Dart's StreamController to manage the state of the application in a reactive manner.
Use Cases: Implements domain-specific use cases that encapsulate the core business logic of the application.
Repository Pattern: Integrates the repository pattern to abstract data sources and provide a clean interface for data access.
Dependency Injection: Utilizes dependency injection for decoupling modules and facilitating easier unit testing and code maintenance.
Unit Testing: Includes unit tests for use cases and other business logic components to ensure correctness and reliability.
Clean and Scalable Code: Follows best practices and design patterns to keep the codebase clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.
